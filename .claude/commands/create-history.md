# CREATE HISTORY ENTRY

Your task is to create a log entry of what was changed within this code base since the last log entry.

- This is supposed to be non-technical, from a user perspective. 
- What benefits have been achieved with this change? 
- If only technical changes have been made: Do not dive into details. Refactoring simply means: The code has been cleaned up to make it easier to maintain

## Existing files

!`ls -la docs/History`

## Template:

!`cat docs/History/template.md`

## Instructions

- Always write in German
- Find and read the latest log file from the list above. Find the latest entry and its git commit hash
- Check all code changes on the current branch since this commit.
- Create a new entry. Either create the log file for the current day based on the template or append a new entry to todays log file. The filename is always yyyy-mm-dd.md
